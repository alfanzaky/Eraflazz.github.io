# 👋 Hi, I'm Alfan Rozak

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught web developer and tech enthusiast from Indonesia.  
I love exploring web development, UI/UX design, and modern tools that make digital experiences more powerful and user-friendly.

Currently, I'm focused on learning:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Android development using Android Studio
- Building personal projects and digital portfolios

Although I'm still learning, I'm passionate about turning ideas into working products and solving problems with code.
